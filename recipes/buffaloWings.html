    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Chicken wings</strong> – Use fresh or thawed frozen wings that
        are broken down into drumettes and wingettes
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Baking powder</strong> – The secret ingredient for getting your
        chicken wings ultra-crispy without the need for deep frying
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Salt</strong> – we use fine sea salt in nearly all of our
        cooking
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Garlic powder</strong> – adds a bit of zest to your wings before
        tossing them in the buffalo sauce
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Unsalted butter</strong> – adds a nice creaminess to the buffalo
        sauce
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Frank’s Original Red Hot Sauce</strong> – This is the perfect
        base for your wing sauce. It’s tangy, a little sweet, and has just the
        right amount of spiciness.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Sugar</strong> – helps the sauce caramelize and thicken on your
        piping hot wings.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Prep Chicken Wings</strong> – cut wings in half to separate the
        drums from the wingettes. Pat the wings dry with a paper towel. Preheat
        the oven and line a rimmed baking sheet with foil and place a wire rack
        over the pan.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Make dry seasoning</strong> – Combine baking powder, salt, and
        garlic powder.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Season the wings</strong> – Place the chicken wings in a large
        mixing bowl and toss them in the dry seasoning until well-coated.
        Assemble the wings in a single layer over the rack.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Bake</strong> in the center of the oven for 50 minutes, flipping
        halfway.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Make the Buffalo Sauce</strong> – In a medium bowl, stir
        together melted butter, sugar, and hot sauce.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Toss Wings in Sauce</strong> – Transfer chicken wings to a bowl,
        and toss, drizzle with sauce and toss to coat. Serve with your favorite
        sauce.
      </li>
    </ol>
